Building Your AI Creative Suite: An A-to-Z Guide
This document provides a complete roadmap for building your application, which will offer AI-powered image generation, image upscaling, and video generation.

1. Core Architecture
Given your requirements, a modern, serverless, full-stack architecture using Next.js is the ideal choice.

Frontend: Built with React (via Next.js).

Backend: Implemented as API Routes within the same Next.js application.

Why this architecture?

Simplicity: You manage a single codebase for both frontend and backend.

Performance: Next.js offers server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for a fast user experience.

Scalability: Vercel (the creator of Next.js) provides seamless, scalable, serverless deployment.

(Image Gen/Up)      (Video Gen)       (Save Metadata)        (Store Media)          (Handle Payment)

2. Prerequisites & Initial Setup
Before you write any code, you need to set up accounts for all the services you'll be using.

Node.js & npm: Make sure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed on your machine.

Code Editor: VS Code is highly recommended.

Create Accounts:

Google Cloud Platform (GCP): For Imagen and Veo APIs. You'll need to enable the Vertex AI API.

Clerk: For authentication. Create a new application in your Clerk dashboard.

Supabase: For your database. Create a new project.

Cloudflare: For R2 storage. You will need to create an R2 bucket.

PhonePe: Register for a merchant account to get API keys for the payment gateway.

(Optional) Replicate: For the Wan 2.1 video model. It provides a simple API for open-source models.

Initialize Next.js Project:

npx create-next-app@latest your-app-name

During setup, choose TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability.

3. Backend Development (Next.js API Routes)
Your backend will live in the src/pages/api/ directory. Each file here becomes a serverless function. All sensitive operations (calling AI APIs, database writes, file storage) will happen here to protect your API keys.

Key Backend Endpoints to Build:
/api/generate/image:

Receives a prompt and an optional referenceImage from the frontend.

Calls the Google Imagen API.

On success, uploads the generated image to Cloudflare R2.

Saves metadata (prompt, user ID, image URL from R2) to your Supabase generations table.

Returns the public URL of the image.

/api/upscale/image:

Receives an imageUrl to upscale.

Calls the Imagen API's upscaling function.

Uploads the upscaled image to R2 and saves metadata to Supabase.

/api/generate/video:

Receives a prompt and a model choice ('veo' or 'wan2.1').

Based on the choice, calls the appropriate API (Google Veo or Replicate's Wan 2.1).

Video generation is asynchronous. The API will likely return a job ID. You'll need another endpoint to check the status.

/api/generate/video-status/[jobId]:

Polls the video generation service to check if the video is ready.

Once ready, uploads it to R2 and updates the record in Supabase.

/api/payments/initiate:

Receives a planId or amount.

Calls the PhonePe API to create a payment request.

Returns the redirectUrl for the frontend to send the user to.

/api/webhooks/phonepe:

This is a crucial endpoint that PhonePe will call to notify you of payment status.

It must verify the webhook signature.

On success, it updates the user's subscription or credits in your Supabase users or subscriptions table.

4. Frontend Development (React Components)
Your frontend will be built in the src/components/ and src/pages/ directories. For a modern and clean UI, consider using a component library like Shadcn/UI or Mantine.

Key Pages and Components:
Authentication Flow (pages /sign-in & /sign-up):

Clerk provides pre-built components (<SignIn />, <SignUp />) that handle this entire flow for you with just a few lines of code.

Main Generation UI (page /generate):

Tabs for "Image Generation," "Upscale," and "Video Generation."

Input fields for prompts, file uploads for reference images, and model selection dropdowns.

A "Generate" button that calls your backend API routes.

Loading indicators to show while the AI is working.

A display area to show the final result.

User Gallery (page /dashboard):

Fetches and displays a grid of the logged-in user's past generations from your Supabase database.

Billing/Pricing Page (page /pricing):

Displays your subscription plans or credit packages.

Each plan's "Buy Now" button will trigger the call to your /api/payments/initiate endpoint.

Layout and Navigation:

Use Clerk's <UserButton /> component in your navigation bar. It automatically shows the user's profile picture and provides sign-out functionality.

5. Step-by-Step Integrations
a) Clerk (Authentication)
Install: npm install @clerk/nextjs

Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file and add your Clerk keys:

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...

Wrap Your App: In src/pages/_app.tsx, wrap your main component with <ClerkProvider>.

Protect API Routes: Use Clerk's withAuth middleware to secure your backend endpoints.

b) Supabase (Database)
Install: npm install @supabase/supabase-js

Create a Client: Create a utility file (src/lib/supabaseClient.ts) to initialize the Supabase client. You'll get the URL and anon key from your Supabase project settings.

Database Schema: In the Supabase dashboard's SQL Editor, create your tables:

generations: (id, user_id, prompt, image_url, video_url, model_used, created_at)

user_profiles: (id (references auth.users), credits, subscription_status)

Interact: From your backend API routes, use the Supabase client to query and insert data.

c) Cloudflare R2 / Backblaze B2 (Storage)
Both are S3-compatible. Cloudflare R2 is often preferred for its zero egress fees.

Install S3 SDK: npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3

Setup: In your backend, configure the S3 client with your R2/B2 credentials (Endpoint, Access Key, Secret Key).

Upload Logic: When an AI model returns image or video data (e.g., as a base64 string or buffer), your backend will use the S3 SDK's PutObjectCommand to upload it to your bucket.

d) AI & Payment APIs
Google APIs (Imagen/Veo):

Install the Google Cloud client library: npm install @google-cloud/vertexai

In your backend, authenticate using Application Default Credentials (ADC) or a service account key file.

Use the library to make calls to the imagegeneration or videogeneration models.

Wan 2.1 (via Replicate):

Install the Replicate client: npm install replicate

Use your Replicate API token to call the model from your backend.

PhonePe Gateway:

This will be a direct fetch call from your backend to the PhonePe API endpoints.

You will need to construct a request body with your merchant ID, transaction details, and a checksum (a hash generated using your Salt Key) for security.

6. Deployment
Platform: Vercel is the best choice for deploying a Next.js application.

Process:

Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

Import the repository into Vercel.

Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project.

Crucially, add all your environment variables (from .env.local) to the Vercel project settings. This includes keys for Clerk, Supabase, R2, Google AI, and PhonePe.

Deploy. Vercel will handle the build process and deploy your app globally on its edge network.

This plan provides a high-level but complete overview. The key is to tackle one piece at a time: start with user authentication, then build the image generation feature end-to-end, then add payments, and so on. Good luck!
