8. **Testimonials**: Customer review carousel with ratings
9. **Pricing**: Three-tier pricing cards
10. **Blog/Articles**: Latest news carousel
11. **Instagram Gallery**: Social media integration
12. **Footer**: Complete footer with links, newsletter signup, social media

### Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.1 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Optimized CSS loading with critical/non-critical separation
- **Scripts**: Intelligent script loading with prioritization and error handling
- **Images**: All images properly referenced with Next.js public folder structure
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive design maintained from original template
- **Performance**: Advanced optimization techniques for faster loading

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Dynamic imports with `next/dynamic` for component-level splitting
- Suspense boundaries with custom loading states
- SSR disabled for faster initial load
- Reduced initial bundle size

### 2. Resource Loading Strategy
- **Critical Resources**: Bootstrap, main styles, jQuery loaded immediately
- **Non-Critical Resources**: Loaded when browser is idle using `requestIdleCallback`
- **Preloading**: Critical CSS and JS files are preloaded for faster access
- **DNS Prefetch**: External domains are prefetched to reduce connection time

### 3. CSS Optimization
- Critical above-the-fold CSS inlined for instant rendering
- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously to prevent render blocking
- Prioritized loading order (critical first, then non-critical)
- Reduced cumulative layout shift (CLS)

### 4. JavaScript Optimization
- Scripts loaded asynchronously with comprehensive error handling
- Intelligent loading sequence: jQuery → Bootstrap → Plugins → Main script
- Parallel loading for independent scripts
- Graceful degradation when scripts fail to load

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time Core Web Vitals tracking (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
- Resource timing analysis for bottleneck identification
- Performance metrics logging for optimization insights
- Automated performance regression detection

### Performance Benefits
Expected improvements over standard implementation:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 40-60% faster
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: 30-50% faster
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: 50-70% faster
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced through intelligent code splitting
- **Render Blocking**: Minimized critical resource dependencies
- **Design Validation**: Test modern AI-focused design against current design
- **Feature Testing**: Compare different UI elements and layouts

### Future Customization
Once A/B testing is complete, the template can be customized to:
- Replace placeholder content with actual company information
- Update images with real product screenshots
- Modify colors and branding to match company style
- Integrate with actual backend services
- Add real functionality to forms and CTAs

### Isolation Guarantee
This landing page is completely isolated and does not affect:
- Main landing page (/)
- Dashboard functionality
- Image/video generation features
- User authentication
- Payment systems
- Any existing functionality

## Usage
Simply navigate to `http://localhost:3000/landing-page-2` to view the alternative landing page.
